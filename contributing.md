## Issues

### Bug Reports

We use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/redhat-beyond/AcadeMe/issues) to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What actually happens

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.


## Pull requests

<img align="right" width="250" height="150" src="https://theindecisiveeejit.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/size-matters.jpg">

- Make SMALLER pull requests --------------->
- Write useful description and titles
- Have on-point commit messages
- Add comments on your pull request to help guide the reviewer
- Make it visual


### Follow the Code Style Guidelines

Ensure that your code follows the [PEP 8 Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) before submitting a pull request.

We have also set up Flake8 to ensure that our style guides are being followed.



### Submit finished and well-tested pull requests

Please do not submit pull requests that are still a work in progress. Pull requests should be thoroughly tested and ready to merge before they are submitted.

To test your code, run `pipenv run pytest` while inside the Vagrant machine. Make sure you add your tests too.
